This is a project I worked on which simulates a simple race of 10 cars.
It implements Processing for the visual interface, using hand-drawn animations.
I used this project as tool to learn the many methods of Processing, including but not limited to loading images, manipulating frame rate, simple animations...
The project implements many concepts of Object Oriented Programming, such as Dynamic Binding & Encapsulation.
The buttons can be pressed to slow down, or speed up the simulation, with the third option of resetting it.

I've created 5 cars manufactured before 2010, and 5 cars manufactured after. Each car obtains a random set of colors, and manufacturers.
Through each cycle of the program, each car goes through a random iteration of speeding up, slowing down, or braking.

I've defined cars that were manufactured before 2010 to increase their velocity by 15mph when speeding up, deceasing their velocity by 5mph when slowing down.
Cars manufactured during or after 2010 will increase their velocity by 30mph when speeding up, decreasing by 10mph when slowingn down.
All cars' speed will be set to 0mph when braking.

The program demonstrates that the top 5 winners of the race will always be cars manufactured in 2010 or after.

The src/data file stores all of the animations that I drew for this project.
